  I did not have any questions regarding the assignment. I did, however, forget how to make a footer and a navigation bar without using Bootstrap.
  Once I reviewed the HTML5 elements and properties, I realized it wasn’t difficult to implement manually. 
  This assignment was a good refresher on structuring a webpage using semantic regions and understanding how HTML 
  and CSS interact without relying on frameworks.
