  <h1> The Amazing World of Music</h1>
  <!-- bold text/links -->
  <p>
    I've always been fascinated by the <strong>vocals</strong> and amazing techniques singers
    develop to express emotion through music. Modern singers are becoming more advanced in
    their <strong>range</strong> and control thanks to training resources like
    <a href="https://joinsingr.com/articles/skills-every-singer-needs">skills every singer needs</a>
    and vocal programs offered online, such as
    <a href="https://www.berklee.edu/online/courses">Berklee Online Courses</a>.
    Singers combine creativity, technique, and emotional storytelling to make every performance unique.
