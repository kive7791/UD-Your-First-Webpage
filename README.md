# UD: Learn More About Me
This website is a personal introduction that gives visitors a glimpse into who I am: my interests, background, and creative journey. It’s designed as a simple, responsive webpage built with Bootstrap, featuring a navigation bar, an “About Me” section, and custom styling using CSS.

## What I’m Using
- HTML5 for page structure
- CSS3 for styling and color themes
- Bootstrap 5 for layout and responsive design
- GitHub Pages for hosting

## Features
- A responsive navigation bar with links to Home, Resume, and Works
- A personalized “About Me” section with text and imagery
